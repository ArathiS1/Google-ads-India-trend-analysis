- A clear visualization of the historical trend annotated with real-world events.
- An analysis of seasonal patterns within a year.
- A 24-month forecast with confidence intervals.
- Data-driven business recommendations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `tidyverse` (dplyr, ggplot2), `lubridate`, `forecast`, `ggthemes`
- **Software:** RStudio
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Data Source:** Google Trends

## üîç Key Insights
1.  **Hyper-Growth Post-2020:** Search interest for "Google Ads" in India saw a massive surge of over 200% following the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a permanent digital shift.

## üìä Methodology and Process
1.  **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Downloaded data from Google Trends and cleaned it using `dplyr` and `lubridate`.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Created initial line plots to visualize the overall trend.
3.  **Time Series Decomposition:** Used `stl()` to break down the series into Trend, Seasonal, and Remainder components.
4.  **Forecasting:** Implemented a Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model (`HoltWinters()`) to account for trend and seasonality for forecasting.
5.  **Business Analysis:** Enhanced plots with annotations, period shading, and event labels to provide business context.
6.  **Visualization:** Used `ggplot2` to create publication-quality, insightful graphs.

## üîÆ Future Work
- Incorporate additional variables like macroeconomic indicators (GDP, internet penetration rates) into a multivariate forecasting model.
- Perform a comparative analysis with search interest for competing platforms like "Facebook Ads" or "Amazon Advertising".
- Develop an interactive Shiny dashboard to allow users to explore the data and forecasts themselves.
